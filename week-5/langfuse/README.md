# LangFuse LLM Observability Platform

## What is LangFuse and Why AI Engineers Need It

LangFuse is an open-source LLM engineering platform that provides observability, evaluation, and prompt management for AI applications. Unlike traditional monitoring tools, LangFuse is designed for the challenges of building with large language models, where non-deterministic outputs, multi-step workflows, and the need to track costs and quality make debugging challenging.

For AI engineers, LangFuse solves the problem of visibility into your LLM applications. When you're building systems that involve multiple API calls to language models, data processing pipelines, retrieval operations, and business logic, it becomes impossible to debug issues without proper observability. LangFuse captures the execution context of your AI applications, making it easy to understand what went wrong, where, and why.

The platform is particularly valuable because it's model and framework agnostic, meaning you can use it with OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, PydanticAI, LlamaIndex, or any other AI toolchain. This flexibility makes it an essential tool for production AI applications where you need consistent monitoring across different components and providers.

## Getting Started with LangFuse

Setting up LangFuse is straightforward and free to get started. Head to [langfuse.com](https://langfuse.com) and create an account using GitHub or email. The platform offers a free tier that includes unlimited traces for development and up to 1,000 traces per month for production use, along with all core features including prompt management and evaluations.

Once you have an account, create a new project and you'll receive three credentials: a public key, secret key, and host URL. These should be stored in your environment variables as `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_HOST`. The setup is minimally invasive - in most cases, you can start getting value from LangFuse by adding a single decorator to your functions or importing the OpenAI integration.

LangFuse also offers [self-hosting options](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host) if you prefer to keep your data within your own infrastructure, which is valuable for enterprise AI applications with strict data governance requirements.

## Understanding the LangFuse Data Model

LangFuse's data model is built around hierarchical observability, inspired by OpenTelemetry but optimized for LLM applications. The core building blocks are **Traces**, **Observations**, **Sessions**, and **Scores**.

**Traces** represent a single request or operation in your application, typically corresponding to one API call or user interaction. Each trace captures the input and output, along with metadata like user information, session details, and custom tags. Within each trace, you can have multiple **Observations** that log individual steps of the execution.

**Observations** come in three types: **Events** for discrete actions, **Spans** for durations of work, and **Generations** for LLM API calls. Generations are powerful because they automatically calculate token usage and costs while capturing the full prompt and completion context. Observations can be nested to represent hierarchical workflows, making it easy to trace through multi-step AI processes.

**Sessions** allow you to group related traces together, which is essential for conversational AI applications where multiple interactions form a user experience. This is useful for chatbots, multi-turn assistants, or any application where context carries across multiple requests.

**Scores** provide the evaluation layer, allowing you to attach quality metrics to any trace, observation, or session. These can be numeric values, boolean flags, or categorical assessments, and they can come from automated evaluations, user feedback, or manual annotation.

## The Three Major Benefits of LangFuse

### 1. Tracing and Debugging

LangFuse's tracing capabilities provide visibility into your AI applications. Unlike traditional logging, LangFuse captures the full execution context including prompts, completions, intermediate steps, and the relationships between them. This is crucial for AI applications because errors often depend on specific input data or prompt variations that are impossible to reproduce without seeing the execution context.

The platform automatically tracks timing information, allowing you to identify performance bottlenecks in AI workflows. You can see how long each LLM call takes, where retrieval operations are slow, and which parts of your pipeline are causing latency issues. This insight is essential for optimizing AI applications for production use.

### 2. Cost Optimization and Usage Tracking

One of the immediate benefits of LangFuse is its automatic cost tracking and optimization features. The platform automatically calculates and tracks token usage and costs across all your LLM providers, giving you insights into where your AI budget is being spent. This is valuable as AI applications scale and costs can quickly spiral out of control without proper monitoring.

LangFuse provides breakdowns by user, feature, model, and time period, making it easy to identify cost drivers and optimize your application. You can track costs across different models and providers, helping you make decisions about which models to use for different use cases. The platform also helps you identify inefficient prompts or excessive API calls that might be driving up costs.

### 3. Advanced Prompt Management

LangFuse's prompt management system addresses one of the challenging aspects of AI application development: managing and iterating on prompts in production. The platform provides centralized prompt storage with version control, allowing you to deploy new prompts without code changes and quickly rollback if issues arise.

The prompt management system includes A/B testing capabilities, performance metrics comparison, and integration with the tracing system to understand how prompt changes affect application behavior. You can track which prompt versions perform better, monitor quality metrics across different prompts, and collaborate with non-technical team members who can update prompts through the web interface without touching code.

This is powerful when combined with LangFuse's evaluation features, as you can automatically score different prompt versions and make data-driven decisions about which prompts to deploy to production.

## Prompt Management in Practice

LangFuse's prompt management acts as a Content Management System (CMS) for your AI prompts, enabling you to decouple prompt engineering from application deployment. Instead of hardcoding prompts in your codebase, you can store, version, and manage them centrally through LangFuse.

### Key Features

**Model Configuration Storage**: Prompts can include a `config` object that stores model parameters like temperature, max tokens, and even the model name itself. This means you can change not just the prompt text but also the model behavior without touching your code.

**Labels for Environment Management**: Use labels like `production`, `staging`, or `experimental` to control which prompt version your application uses. When you call `langfuse.get_prompt("prompt-name")`, it automatically fetches the version labeled as `production`. This enables instant prompt deployments and easy rollbacks.

**Automatic Versioning**: Every time you create or update a prompt, LangFuse automatically increments the version number. You can track the history of changes, compare performance across versions, and rollback to previous versions if needed.

**Template Variables**: Prompts support template variables using double bracket syntax `{{variable_name}}`, which you can compile at runtime with actual values using the `prompt.compile()` method.

### Workflow Example

```python
# 1. Register a prompt (usually done once)
langfuse.create_prompt(
    name="customer-email",
    prompt="Write a {{tone}} email to {{customer_name}} about {{topic}}",
    config={"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.7},
    labels=["production"]
)

# 2. Use in your application
prompt = langfuse.get_prompt("customer-email")
compiled_prompt = prompt.compile(
    tone="friendly", 
    customer_name="John", 
    topic="service update"
)
```

This approach enables prompt engineers and product teams to iterate on prompts through the LangFuse UI while developers focus on application logic. The `prompt-management.py` example demonstrates this workflow with a minimal implementation.

## Examples and Getting Started

The `langfuse-setup.py` file in this directory demonstrates both basic LangFuse integration and a business use case. The examples show how to use the `@observe()` decorator for automatic tracing, structured output with Pydantic models, and custom metadata tracking. These examples illustrate how minimal the integration can be while providing observability.

The customer support automation example demonstrates real-world usage patterns including multi-step workflows, structured data extraction, and business-relevant metadata tracking. This provides a template for integrating LangFuse into production AI applications.
